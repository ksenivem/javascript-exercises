// Lesson 02 exercise: Variables and data types
// In your exercise repository, create a branch named `lesson-02-exercise` and switch to it,
// then open `lesson-02.js`. The questions are inside as comments, and the file begins with the
// strict mode line. Work through the parts in order, beneath each question.

// TODO: Part one.
// Declare five variables that describe a small shop of your choosing, mixing `const` and `let`
// deliberately and naming everything in camelCase. Log each variable, and add a one-line
// comment justifying every choice between `const` and `let`.

const cafeName = "Rabbit Cafe"; //name of the cafe will never change
let orderCount = 7; // order amount will change depending on the number of customers
const phoneNumber = "123456789"; // cafes phone number will never change
let finalPrice = 20; // Final price changes depending on the order.
let isInstock = true; // Product in stock is a value that changes depending on availability.

console.log(cafeName);
console.log(orderCount);
console.log(phoneNumber);
console.log(finalPrice);
console.log(isInstock);

// TODO: Part two.
// Log the `typeof` result for each of your five variables, and additionally for `null` and for
// `undefined`. Note in a comment which one of these results is a famous historical bug of the
// language.

console.log(typeof cafeName);
console.log(typeof orderCount);
console.log(typeof phoneNumber);
console.log(typeof finalPrice);
console.log(typeof isInstock);
console.log(typeof null); //is a historical bug which classifies null as an "object"
console.log(typeof undefined);

// TODO: Part three.
// Declare one variable without assigning it a value, and a second variable set to `null` on
// purpose. Log both values and both `typeof` results, and state the difference between the two
// kinds of nothing in one comment sentence.
let sundaySpecials;
console.log(sundaySpecials);
console.log(typeof sundaySpecials);

let shoppingBasket = null;
console.log(shoppingBasket);
console.log(typeof shoppingBasket);
//null means that it was intentionally left empty, and undefined means that probably was a bug since no value was set.
// TODO: Part four.
// Convert the three provided string values to their intended types using `Number()` and
// `Boolean()`, and convert one number of your own to a string with `String()`. Log each result
// together with its `typeof`, and note in a comment which conversion would produce `NaN` if
// the string were not a clean number.

// * The three provided string values:
const priceText = "4.50";
console.log(Number(priceText), typeof Number(priceText));

const countText = "12";
console.log(Number(countText), typeof Number(countText));

const flagText = "true";
console.log(Boolean(flagText), typeof Boolean(flagText));

const randomNumber = 17;
console.log(String(randomNumber), typeof String(randomNumber));

//a conversion that would produce "NaN" the string were not a clean number would be if a string would be converted to a number.
// TODO: Part five.
// The file ends with a short broken program that contains a reassigned `const`, an assignment
// to a variable that was never declared, and a variable read before its declaration line. Run
// it, read each error message carefully, repair all three problems, and describe each repair
// in one comment line.

// ! This broken program crashes on purpose, one error at a time.
// ! Keep it commented until you reach this part, then uncomment and repair:
let bakeryName = "Maison Sarah"; //const bakeryName was already assigned as "Maison Sarah". Changed const to let.
bakeryName = "The Corner Bakery";
let openingHour = 7; //declare a variable with let
let loafCount = 12; //declared a variable first before the declaration line
console.log(loafCount);
// TODO: Part six.
// Two variables, `a` and `b`, hold different values. Swap their contents using a third,
// temporary variable, and log both afterwards to prove the swap succeeded. This is the oldest
// exercise in programming, and it still earns its place.

let a = 7;
let b = 8;
let temporaryNum = a;
a = b;
b = temporaryNum;

console.log(a);
console.log(b);
// TODO: Save deliberately, commit with a clear message, push the branch, and open a pull request
// into main.
// TODO: Submit the link to the pull request for review.
